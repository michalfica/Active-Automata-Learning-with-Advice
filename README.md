# Active-Automata-Learning-with-Advice

We present the empirical evaluation of the active learing algorithm with advice. 

This repository includes custom implementation of L^{*} algorithm with advice system as well as 
an implenetation build on top of a state-of-the-art automata learing library **learnlib**, which is open source.
